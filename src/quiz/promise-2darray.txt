Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

- Sum called is logged when sum2DArray is called.
- returning from sum is logged right after the promise is created.
- If array is empty, error msg 'Cannot sum an empty array' is logged.
- If the array is not empty, 'Adding to sum' is logged for each element in the array.
- 'Sum is: ' is logged with the sum.
- setTimeout with a 0 delay ensures the summing happens asynchronously, with logs appearing before summing start.
